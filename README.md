Hi guys - I am working on a web site that will feature
outdoors and indoors, days and nights, of Central Virginia.
I have lived in Central Virginia 30 years and have an extensive
(insider) knowledge of the area.

This is a project-in-progress, I hope to have an acceptable/
useful draft version by the end of 2017. I am working alone
on this, but I am open to outside contributors, so if you
are interested (especially if you live in or are familiar
with Central Virginia) send me an email. Both HTML/CSS/JS
experts and content writers are encouraged to join me ;8-)

The layout of the site is in flux and will change, but starting
logic is StayAndSleep, EatAndDrink, HikeAndWalk, DriveAndBike,
FloatAndSwim, and HistoryAndCulture categories. I have a number
of other (interesting/useful/fun) categories I am readying, so
at this point I am also thinking of splitting the web site into
several different sites?

The website is redirected from github pages to enjoy-virginia.com
domain name so you can check it out. 

Cheers, Emil
