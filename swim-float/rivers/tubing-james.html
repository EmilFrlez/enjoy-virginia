<hr>
<p>If it is summer (check the calendar!) it is that time of year again. Let's go tubing!
Grab your sunscreen and spend a lazy summer afternoon floating down the James.</p>

<p>This is a very lazy adventure as all you need to do is sit back in a tube
 and watch the world go by. You will be on the river for 2-5 hours depending
 on the speed of the water. It is average last time on most days for a float on the James River.</p>

<p>Go early to avoid the crowds from James River Runners
 and James River Reeling and Rafting.</p>


<p>You should have a cooler available for your lunch and beverages.

You need to bring:

<ul>
<li>sunscreen (lots of it - the sun reflects off the water as well as beaming from overhead)</li>
<li>chapstick or similar to protect lips,</li>
<li>a lunch, snacks (in a Ziploc plastic bags = might think about double bagging it),</li>
<li>plenty of liquid (consider bringing something in addition to water such 
as gatorade or juice). NO GLASS ON THE RIVER. Please use a Sharpie
 and write your name/initials on your drinks,</li>
<li>rivershoes (old tennis work great) (NO FLIPFLOPS),</li>
<li>hat,</li>
<li>old t-shirt if you want as additional protection against too much sun,</li>
<li>2 towels - one to dry off with, one to sit on in the car,</li>
<li>change of shoes to wear home,</li>
<li>change of clothes if you want,</li>
<li>drybag (optional).</li>
</ul>

<p>It is easier to put your lunch and beverages in the group cooler.
Bring cheap sunglasses as the river has claimed many a pair over the years.
 If you have a dry bag you may want to bring it.</p>

<p>Your river shoes need to be able to stay on you feet securely and comfortably
 for the entire ride. They should also cover your entire foot as there are lots
 of rocks (and possibly glass) in the river. We have had lots of stubbed toes
 and scrapped feet on these trips. Old tennis shoes work best.</p>

<p>Don't forget your towel for the end, other wise you may be riding
 outside the car instead of in it.</p>

<p>There is a new frozen yogurt store in Scottsville.
You may stop there on the way back.</p>

<p>James River Runners charge $23 per tube ($8 for a cooler tube).</p>

<p>NOTICE: This adventure is always weather and river level dependent -
 if the river is too high, the trip will be cancelled.
 Chech the weater and water levels a day before the trip and decide
 if it is a "go" or "no go". Or call either James River Runners or
 James River Reeling and Rafting.</p>
