<hr>
<p>This is a 14 mile ride on one of Virginiaâ€™s newest Rail-to-Trail project
 at the base of the Blue Ridge Mountains.  We will be riding at a leisurely
 pace on mostly flat terrain.  The trail surface is made up of asphalt,
 crushed stone and ballast.  A mountain bike or hybrid bike will be needed
 for this ride.  The trail passes under tall conifers and other deciduous 
 trees while paralleling Piney River near its north bank with plenty of places
 to pull off to get closer to the river.  Near Rose Mill, the trail passes over
 a bridge that traverses the Piney River.</p>

<p>The trail traces the route of the former Virginia Blue Ridge Railway.
 The line originally extended from Tye River Depot, where it interchanged
 with the Southern Railway, to Massies Mill.  The railroad followed
 the course of the Tye and Piney Rivers for several miles before
 entering the mountains.  It passed through the communities of Roses Mill,
 Piney River, Canopy, Lowesville, and Buffalo Mine.
 It was built in 1915 to haul chestnut timber out of the heavily-timbered
 Piney River area to local mills.  Timber runs were halted during World War I,
 since they were not essential to the war effort, 
 and a chestnut blight wiped out much of the timbered areas.</p>
 
 <p>Passenger service carried the line through 1936.  The line saw a true 
 resurgence when a company began extracting titanium dioxide
 from the Piney River and needed transport.  Also, three companies
 were built to extract aplite from the area and used the rail for
 transport and the line thrived until the late 1960s.  
 Hurricane Camille destroyed some of the tracks in 1969 and Cyanamid,
 the company that began the line's industrial boom in the 1930s, closed in 1970.</p>

<p>You will need to bring a bike, helmet, water and snacks.
  You may also want to bring sunscreen, sunglasses, camera and light jacket.
  Don't forget a first aid kit and bike repair kit!</p>
