<p>The Start of this Challenge is May 5th, but you can join in the fun anytime
 before June 11th when the challenge ends.

I have been getting a lot of questions about the scavenger hunt
 challenge I posted for the club that begins today. Just to clarify,
 you do not need a GPS to participate in this challenge.  You also don’t
 need to find all of the caches in one day.  The challenge is open for
 two weeks, so there is plenty of time.

In case the description of the challenge was confusing, here are
 the Clift Notes:  The challenge consists of 3 easy locations to find,
 2 difficult locations (longer drive, longer hike) and 1 super difficult
 location.  None of the locations require technical skills (i.e. rock climbing)
 to reach.

There are two ways to earn prizes.  The first way is to complete all
 the finds for a given level.  For example, if you complete all 
 the easy finds, you will be entered in a drawing for the easy level
 grand prize.  If you complete the two difficult finds, you will be entered
 in the difficult grand prize.  To complete a find, just email me a picture
 of the location.

The other way to earn a prize is to be the first person to find
 a particular find.  Some of the locations have hidden Tupperware
 with a codeword inside.  If you are the first to find the Tupperware,
 take the card with the codeword and email me the codeword.
Participants who paid before the start will receive there Mission
 Packets the morning of the 5th, and have the best shot at treasure items.
 If you join after that, once I receive payment I will email you the Mission Packet.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Alas, my time here in Charlottesville is winding to end. I actually joined  OASC before I signed a lease here! I will try to remain active as a club leader in DC, but only time will tell. As a tribute to all the awesome excursions and amazing friends I have created my own personal Greater Charlottesville/Shenandoah/BlueRidge Adventure Challenge.



What is this Adventure Challenge I speak of you say? Well listen close:



Hidden across our historic town, beautiful valleys and picturesque mountaintops are 6 secret objects in locations close to my own heart from my time here in Cville. They are broken up into 3 classes: Easy, Difficult, and Insane.



You choose how many objects to find, what order to find them in and when you want to find them. Find 1 one day then come back and find 2 more a different day; or find them all at once, your choice. No need to find them all.



EASY

Three objects are located on simple trails. Equivalent to our Light Hike rating.



DIFFICULT

Two objects are on difficult terrain. Finding them will give you an awesome workout. Equivalent to our + to ++ technical difficulty. All well marked, maintained trails, fine to do on your own.



INSANE

For true gluttons for pain and the competitive OASCers, finding the sixth and final object is insane. If you find this, we should hold a parade for you. I wouldn't take a group of OASCers on this, bring your navigation equipment, water shoes, o and an ace bandage. Off trail, no markers, best to do with a friend.



MISSION PACKET & HOW TO FIND THEM

After you register for the adventure, you’ll receive your mission packet that includes pictures of the secret objects, maps of the trails they're on and instructions for what to do once you find them.

The maps won't show you where the objects are. That's for you to discover. You can hike, bike, run, walk, kayak, swim, skydive - find them however you want -  I don't care how, just find them.



CLUES & HIDDEN TREASURE

As a bonus to finding your primary objects, I've also hidden special treasure chests (tupperware) filled with clues & actual treasure along the way. Treasures include vouchers good for food (to my favorite Cville restaurants), outdoor gear, and cash.

Clues include the solution to a coded cipher.

(READ FAQ FOR MORE INFO or see message boards)



GRAND PRIZE CASH POT

When you register, your name and $10 of your registration will be put into a grand prize cash prize pot. After Adventure season closes, we will drawn one name from each of the three classes.

For each class you complete, you'll earn an additional chance in the pot. 25% of the pot goes to the winning name drawn from those who found all three "Easy" class objects; 35% to the winner drawn from those who found the two "Difficult" class objects; 40% to the winner drawn from those that found the "Insane" class object.

REGISTER & EVENT DATES

Adventure season opens May 5th (A special day for me here in Cville) and closes June 11th (the day my moving truck comes). You only have to register once for the entire period.

OASC-The Charity

Part of being an OASCer is to give back in some way.

OASC provided me a way to make lasting friends in my new community and explore the wilderness that the surrounding area has to offer. I can honestly say I've evolved as an outdoorsmen form being with OASC.



In tribute to this, and in support of all the tremendous work OASC leaders do behind the scenes, I am donating a portion of each contestant's entry fee to help continue OASC.

$10 of each registration/event package will go directly to OASC.

(likely to support gear intensive adventures)
