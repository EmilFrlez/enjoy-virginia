<p>Mountain biking is a great form of aerobic exercise.
 It offers a great work out, is low-impact on the joints, typically is
 done in the woods, like hiking can take you to some incredible places,
 and can be very versatile in terms of topographical changes,
 trail styles and conditions, and mountain bike styles and sub-genres.
 Several years ago Mountain Bike Magazine listed Charlottesville
 as the 7th best place to live in the U.S. for mountain biking.
 And rightly so! C'ville is proximal to numerous amazing rides,
 including our very own O-hill trails and the Rivanna trail system,
 along with the wonderful trails of Walnut Creek Park (WCP).
 WCP has miles of single-track
 trails that are appropriate for all experience levels.</p>

<p>The recommended ride is GEARED (ha! get it?) for beginners as you will be riding
 at an easy pace with several stops but all skill levels are welcome.</p>
 

<p>IMPORTANT NOTE ABOUT MOUNTAIN BIKING:
Mountain biking can be a dangerous activity. While it is low impact on
 your joints, as biking in general
 tends to be, but that assumes that you do not fall off the bike
 and land on them! What I love most about mountain biking,
 second to the aerobic work out, is how technical it can be.
 It takes a coordination between strength and balance to effectively
 pedal over the bumps in the trail. Falling over happens,
 but hopefully not to you!</p>

<p>PREREQUISITES:
Prior MOUNTAIN biking experience is not necessary, but some experience
 on a bike is. You should also be in decent shape; even though
 we will be riding at an easy pace, mountain biking is very strenuous.
 WCP is quite hilly and the dirt, rocks, roots, logs, etc.
 make climbing those hills more challenging than you might expect.</p>

<p>AN IMPORTANT NOTE ABOUT WCP:
The beach at WCP is open from Memorial Day weekend to Labor Day
 which results in an entrance fee during that season.
 It is $3.00 for adult Albemarle County residents and $4.50
 for non-Albemarle County adult residents. I have reflected
 this cost as $5 in the adventure fee.</p>

<p>YOU SHOULD BRING:
A bike and/or helmet, wear athletic clothes
 (preferably shorts but if you wear pants be sure they are
 not baggy as the chain ring will eat them!), sneakers,
 water bottle (bike bottle or 16-20oz bottle), PLENTY of water
 (it'll be HOT) and snacks, sunscreen, swimwear and towel if
 you want to swim after the ride.</p>
