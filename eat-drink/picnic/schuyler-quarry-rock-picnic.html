<p>
Believe me, the Schuyler Quarry Rock is a unique place
to have a picnic. Take a buddy, group of friends, invite a romantic date,
bring your dog, and the reaction will be "whaoh!" (or aw, aw ;8-)
You might get hooked!<p>

<p>Now you are asking "quarry"?, "rock?", "quarry rock" in Schuyler?
What is all that about? Check it out on google maps, the geo-location
of the "graffiti" quarry is given above. You can count ten quarries
on the <a href="http://tinyurl.com/y77cnc2g">map</a>, all within 1,000
feet from the Schyler Rd/Quarry Hill Ln
point, but none of the are visible from the road. Park to the side
Schuyler Rd (there is a dirt area just north of Rt 808, big enough
 for ten or so cars) 
and walk up the hill. Take a picnic blanket and picnic bag with you.
 Surprise!</p>  


<p>If you want to take a dip, going from  late April up until 
the end of September would be ideal. You can either try to impress your
friends and jump off the top of the rock the choices are 15 feet jump or
(breath-taking) 25 feet jump! You can also just walk around the quarry
and get into water at the ground level. Quarry water is warmer than
any flowing swimming hole water. Some scuba diving cerification schools
in Central Virginia use this quarry for practice portion of the exam.</p>

<p>Background: the quarries are located in Schuyler, VA, which is about 30-35
 minutes south of Charlottesvilleille down Route 29. They were dug by and
 located near the Alberene Soapstone Company, which is
 is no longer active, but can still be located on Google Maps.
 If you look at the satellite view, you can pretty easily see 
 where the quarries are located along Schuyler Rd.</p>

<p>To get there is pretty simple: Take 29 south for about
 25-30 minutes, then turn left onto Irish Rd. Follow that
 for a few miles, then turn right onto Schuyler Rd. After
 a few minutes, you'll see Gold Mine Ln on your right hand
 side: turn onto it and park along the side of the road.</p>

<p>Now, some of other quarries are somewhat difficult to reach,
 some don't really have any good spots to jump from, and some
 are located virtually in some peoples' back yards, so you'll
 probably avoid those. One of the easiest to access is
 the triagle-shaped one located almost right across
 the street from the intersection of Schuyler Rd and
 Gold Mine Ln. The highest jump there is about 25-30
 feet (a rough estimation from someone who hasn't done this
 for a few years), but there are shorter places to jump from
 as well if you want to work your courage up.</p>
 
<p>Some of the other popular ones are located to the east of
 that first quarry. Walk up Schuyler Rd a ways, then go
 right onto Quarry Hill Ln where it branches off. There
 is a makeshift path through the woods (though it can be
 somewhat hard to find) that takes you to a series
 of roughly square-shaped quarries, where you can jump
 from much higher heights (probably approaching 60 ft).
 You'll be able to spot the one that's most popular, 
 as it will be the easiest to reach and will have
 the most graffiti. As well, someone has rigged a rope to help
 divers climb out of the water and make their way back
 to the jump spot (though perhaps that might be gone now).
